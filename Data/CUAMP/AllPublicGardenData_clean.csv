Ridgeway Enabling Garden is one of a handful of green spaces in Chicago created with the needs of a particular segment of the population in mind. One of the oldest community gardens in North Lawndale, the space is used regularly by all local residents, but it was created to welcome the many senior citizens who live on the block and in the immediate vicinity. The specially designed beds of flowers and other blooming plants encircling the spacious corner lot are raised several feet above the ground, enabling seniors to care for the plants in comfort and increasing their activity both physically and socially.

But the garden?s benefits are not limited to just the older residents. According to community leader Willie Marks, the presence of the 1900 S. Ridgeway Enabling Garden has played a significant role in the greening of the neighborhood and stimulating both social and educational activities among residents of all ages. It has prompted many homeowners on the block to plant gardens of their own, creating a continuous stretch of vibrant hues that virtually glow in the summer sun. Neighborhood children work in the Enabling Garden alongside the adults, pulling weeds and performing other tasks, as well as learning about the different plants ? almost as if they have their own outdoor classroom. One of the immediate goals for the garden is the installation of plaques identifying each plant species and its characteristics.

NeighborSpace worked with the 1900 S. Ridgeway Block Club to keep the space a permanent garden ? an important milestone for the community because the garden had evolved into a significant gathering place for not only the seniors tending it, but all residents who had come to appreciate it as an urban oasis.",24,NORTH LAWNDALE,,,Chicago

Its mission is to serve the community in the southeast corner of Humboldt Park. It?s a collaboration by neighbors seeking to bring more community space to the area, growing their own food in a food desert, beautifying the area, and growing as a community. The garden?s location is on an abandoned CHA lot at the corner of Mozart and Walton Avenue which has been vacant for over 16 years. The vision of this garden is a children?s garden where children can grow their own sunflowers, sugar snap peas, and bean teepees. Gardeners will provide instruction on water conservation, composting, plant care, nutrition, and cooking with fresh produce.

Cultural activities will involve art instruction and entertainment to be provided by neighborhood artists such as musicians and professional potters. In order to engage a broader community, the gardeners hope to install raised beds with seating for neighbors who are elderly and disabled.",26,WEST TOWN,,,Chicago

What was once an empty city lot adjacent to a graffiti-laced wall is now a florally diverse, peaceful garden with a mural of mystical realism. With the help of students, parents, community members, businesses, and numerous gardening organizations, this vision has become a reality. 

In 1997 NeighborSpace adopted our garden, providing us with insurance and also a water supply. In 2013, we doubled our size, adding one city lot, with the help of NeighborSpace (and Alderman Solis) and a few friends.

Fourteen teachers signed on to introduce to their students the joys of working in a garden.  Parents and volunteers prepared a 100' x 16' plot just south of the school's entrance on Clifton Avenue.  The kids started seeds, created worm bins, tilled their plots and finally planted some plants!    

Our main garden plot contained 16 individual 6' x 7' plots:  each classroom chose garden co-captains who were in charge of their class plot.  One 5th grade class had so many students who wanted to be garden captains that they had to write a letter, give a speech and be selected by their fellow classmates in order to earn their title (see....gardening can be cool too).  

Three eighth grade classes partnered with DePaul students studying biodiversity and together they designed and planted two containers flanking our front entrance featuring plants native to Illinois.

In the 7 years that we have had The Garden Project up and running, there have been some changes but our goals remain the same.  We want to get our students interested in where food comes from, learn about our hard-working pollinators, create awareness about our environment, take the learning outside of the building and to help other Chicago Public Schools create their own schoolyard gardens.  We also want to shout from the rooftops that playing in the dirt is fun!

Thank you to all of the families who have contributed their time (and sweat) to The Garden Project and to Principal Katie Konieczny for her full support.  And a big thank you to the wonderful teachers at Oscar Mayer Magnet School for your enthusiasm and patience.",32,LINCOLN PARK,oscarmayerwst@yahoo.com,,Chicago

We provide students with educational training opportunities in the areas of Independent Functioning, Social Learning, Vocational, and Applied Academics. 

Although our school has had a horticulture program and a raised bed garden since it was founded in 1988, our expectations for the potential of these gardens when integrated into our curricula have increased dramatically in the past four years. We have expanded from the one raised bed to the building and use of a learning garden created in cooperation with The Kitchen Community and seven in-ground gardens created in cooperation with an architecture firm called VOA, as well as a fruit tree orchard and landscaping projects around the school. The building of each of these areas has incorporated school-wide activities and we all appreciate the green space, the harvested food, and the beauty of the gardens!

The horticulture, agriculture, science, and building maintenance classes maintain the growing areas. Students in these classes, as well as Culinary Arts and Daily Living classes, reap the benefits of the harvest. We are in the process of planning more community events in the garden and will also start raising bees with the West Side Bee Boyz in this coming spring of 2016.

If you'd like to learn more about us, please visit southsideoccupational.org If you have any advice for how we could better incorporate academic, independent living, or cooking classes into the gardens, please contact gksullivan1@cps.edu Thank you!",17,WEST ENGLEWOOD,"773-535-9100, gksullivan1@cps.edu",,Chicago

Everyone deserves to have a good job, and everyone deserves to eat well.

Our mission is to operate, demonstrate and promote the use of organic agriculture as a vehicle for job training, employment and community development.

Growing Home is a not for profit social enterprise that operates two certified organic production farms in West Englewood. We use these farms as the base for our hands-on transitional jobs program for people with barriers to employment. Production Assistants (PA's) work and study with us for up to 14 weeks, getting paid for this experience. During this time we work with PA's to prepare them for jobs all along the food chain throughout the Chicago area. In 2014, 87% of our graduates found full-time employment. 

Growing Home began working in Englewood in 2006, developing the city's first, and still only, certified organic farm on a little more than 1/2 acre of land. We added our Honore St. farm next-door in 2011. We now have 1.5 acres of land that we farm, and are looking for new land nearby.

We have been at the forefront of developing Englewood's urban agriculture district. Today there are four urban farms in Englewood, and many community gardens.

Acting as an ?unofficial? gateway to North Lawndale is the Velma Johnson Memorial Garden (previously knows as the 3400 Flournoy Block Club Garden), a welcoming corner space at Homan and Flournoy filled with trees, shrubs and flower beds that evolved from a weekly gathering of residents who met to clean out a vacant lot that tended to attract a large amount of garbage.

Since NeighborSpace helped conserve it as a garden, the Velma Johnson Memorial Garden has undergone several transformations, some out of necessity, but most in order for the garden to continue serving the changing needs of the surrounding community. Former local leader Velma Johnson, in whose memory the garden was named, noted that the garden?s first ground covering was replaced with the existing soft, thick turf after unwanted weeds kept surfacing through the original base of wood chips. In recent years several large wooden benches featuring flower planters were added to the middle of the garden where there is ample shade, and an arched trellis was erected at the Flournoy entrance, blossoming in sweet-smelling, colorful flowers each summer. Today the focus of the Velma Johnson Memorial Garden is primarily on providing families with a place to gather with their neighbors. The lack of other park space nearby makes the garden that much more valuable to the community.",24,EAST GARFIELD PARK,,,Chicago

There are currently a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and perennials in the arboretum, including apple and pear trees that were sagging with fruit in early August 2008.

Named by a local schoolgirl as a result of an essay contest for the garden, its flower-filled expanse covers one full lot. Prior to the garden?s establishment, the lots were home to a wide range of trash and abandoned vehicles and had been the site of a sexual assault in the early 90s.

In the case of the creation of Warner Park and Gardens that catalyst was Lois Buenger, a longtime resident and educator in the North Center neighborhood. According to Wilma Scharrer, a member of the Warner Park and Gardens community group, Lois led by example when she countered a developer?s bid to build on an unused lot ? a project that would have eliminated a 100-year-old ginkgo tree. Her energy and efforts rallied the entire neighborhood which, with the help of local businesses and organizations, including NeighborSpace, won ownership of the lot and laid the foundation for the creation of a community green space. ?Her vision was of more than a garden,? Ms. Scharrer says of Lois. ?The early fundraising efforts reflected the various individuals and groups who dreamt with her.?

Today Warner Park and Gardens has fulfilled Lois? vision.

It was a dump: barren, eroded, and a hiding place for rascals of all types. Neighbors began by removing tons of debris, trimming back vines, building steps, paths, and terraces, and planting with native plants. The plant community helped to create a turf that reduced erosion. The clearing of non-native brush helped make it possible to see the river from the top of the bank, and the paths and steps created easy access for families, moms and dads and kids, oldsters, and fisherfolk. The founders were mostly locals that liked to work with others and wanted a more beautiful place to live.

All of the park?s managed area is native plant communities including woodlands and prairies. Riverbank Neighbors works with the Nature Conservancy, the North Branch Restoration Project, Waters Elementary School, and Friends of the Chicago River. They probably have almost 100 different species of native plants, including some young heritage bur oaks from Waters school and a variety of other shrubs including hazelnut, elderberry, and gooseberry. The nighbors celebrate the beginning of each season with a big community potluck, sometimes hosted at a neighbors house, often outdoors. The Riverbank Neighbors birthed the Bullfrogs Community Choir that sings an eclectic mix of songs for many community events.

Evanston and Skokie are part of a regional food system that produces only 3% of the food we consume. (Although Illinois is a farm state, most of the food we grow is exported for agricultural or manufacturing purposes.) As a result, we depend on corporate food purveyors for our meals. An urban farm can help provide us with healthy, locally grown foods we can trust. 

In 2006, the Talking Farm was created and at that time, there was no physical farm, so our main mission was to provide educational programming on growing and harvesting, vegetables and fruit. 

In 2009, the Edible Acre Pilot Project at Evanston Township High School was initiated and has continued to this day.

In 2011, thanks to the Skokie Park District, a use agreement was signed for use of the land at 3701 Howard Street, and the Howard Street Farm established. 

The Talking Farm continues to expand its activities and there are many opportunities for volunteers. 

Our educational programs are complemented by and dependent on our working farm, but developing a farm from the ground up is a huge undertaking that constantly challenges the resources of our fledgling grassroots organization. The growth of our farm is central to the growth of our educational initiatives

Some of our accomplishments in 2016: 
?	Grew over 8,200 pounds of 27 different varieties of organically-grown vegetables that were distributed to the community, sold at farmers' markets, or donated to food pantries
?	One of only a few urban farms in Chicagoland that plants in-ground and engages in leading-edge healthy soil and sustainability initiatives that will serve as examples to the community
?	Expanded a comprehensive internship and FarmHand program that teaches people how to farm sustainably and acts as a feeder program for other urban farming initiatives.
?	Provide hands-on volunteering and educational opportunities for school-aged children, community groups and companies interested in sustainability or urban farming",0,0,info@thetalkingfarm.org,,Skokie
